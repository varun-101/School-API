## üîç Distance Calculation

The API uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two geographical points. This provides accurate distance measurements taking into account the Earth's curvature.

## üß™ Testing

A Postman collection is provided for testing all API endpoints. The collection includes:
- Valid test cases for adding schools in different locations
- Test cases for listing schools from different reference points
- Error test cases for validation and error handling
